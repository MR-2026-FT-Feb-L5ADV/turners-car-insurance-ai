# Turners Car Insurance AI Prototype

This project is a cloud-based prototype that uses Azure AI to recognize vehicle types from uploaded images. The goal is to explore how AI can help support Turners Car Insurance by automatically identifying vehicles as part of the insurance process.

This repository will include project documentation, stakeholder analysis, and the AI prototype.

## Architecture

This system follows a layered cloud architecture:

Client Layer → React frontend for image upload  
Application Layer → Node.js backend API for processing  
Cloud AI Layer → Azure AI Vision for vehicle recognition
